Perl implementation of the bitcoin protocol


* bitcoin-related libraries
* electrum client
* elliptic curve cryptography in pure perl

Requires v5.14 and beyond, at least because of an extensive use of the 'r'
modificator in s///

Requires dc, the unix desktop calculator, as it is much faster than Math::BigInt, even
with GMP.

Requires also: BerkeleyDB, Perl6::Junction, Crypt::Rijndael, File::Map
