* bitcoin-related libraries
* electrum client (Not Yet Implemented)
* elliptic curve cryptography in pure perl

Requires v5.14 and beyond, at least because of an extensive use of the 'r'

Requires dc, the unix desktop calculator, as it is much faster than Math::BigInt, even
with GMP.

Requires also: BerkeleyDB, Convert::ASN1, File::Map, Net::IRC
