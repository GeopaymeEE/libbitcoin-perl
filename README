Perl implementation of the bitcoin protocol

* bitcoin-related libraries
* electrum client
* elliptic curve cryptography in pure perl

Requires v5.14 and beyond, at least because of an extensive use of the 'r'
modifier in s///

Requires dc, the unix desktop calculator, as it is much faster than Math::BigInt, even
with GMP.

Requires also: BerkeleyDB, Convert::ASN1, Crypt::Rijndael, File::Map

THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS, PROVIDED WITH ABSOLUTELY NO GUARANTEE WHATSOEVER
